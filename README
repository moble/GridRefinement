These two programs simply translate between a minimal waveform and
a uniform-timestep waveform.  Compilation is trivial -- 'make'
should work.

Then, given a single waveform data file (one L,M mode), you can
compress the file with something like

  MinimizeGrid FileName.dat

This will output FileName.dat.minimal, which can then be
reconstituted with something like

  ReconstituteGrid FileName.dat.minimal

For multiple L,M modes, just use xargs.  Maybe

  ls *dat | xargs -t -n 1 MinimizeGrid
  ls *minimal | xargs -t -n 1 ReconstituteGrid

More details and further options are given by

  MinimizeGrid --help
  ReconstituteGrid --help

In particular, note that the tolerances can be set on MinimizeGrid.
For example, if you want the reconstituted grid to be within 1e-5
of the original, you can enter

  MinimizeGrid FileName.dat 1e-5

You can also enter separate tolerances for the amplitude and phase:

  MinimizeGrid FileName.dat 1e-6 1e-7

Here, 1e-6 is the tolerance on the amplitude and 1e-7 is the
tolerance on the phase.
